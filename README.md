# AirBnB Listings Audit

#### With cities like Tacoma experiencing ever increasing rent prices and decreasing housing availibility, lawmakers are facing an enourmous challenge in stopping its citizens from being priced out of their homes. One measure that Tacoma and others have tried is to drastically reduce the restrictions on permitting construction of Accessory Dwelling Units in hopes that homeowners with land to spare might create separate units on their properties, thus increasing housing density and providing some lower cost rental options.

#### As a former General Contractor I'm keenly aware that people often get through the building inspections process with final approvals in order, and then just do what they want without any regard for regulations. One concern I have with the above legislation is that it seems too easy for people to just turn their new units into short term rentals on AirBNB. Might be a problem, no? 

#### Luckily, there is a way to answer this question! To start, we need to get all local listings from Airbnb.com, the hows of which were explained very well by Youber, StevesieData, in this video:<i> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7pGIpitSlM </i>

#### More work will need to be done to give a more precise answer. For instance you'd need to filter out some of the Condo buildings with legal business permissions for this type of activity. Furthermore, the 2019 ordinace for more ADUs says that homeowners can only offer their units as short term listings while living on the property - this level of data analysis does not account for how to approach this kind of activity for people that own multiple homes that could be rented before 2019. I will be expanding on this in later work, but it's an interesting start. With 500 listings in Tacoma, over half of which are hosted by users with more than 1 Airbnb rental, might it be time to reconsider how much leeway renters are given? 

#### For any questions, please reach out me at <b>icampsmith@gmail.com</b>. I'd love to do this for more cities outside of my hometown if there is an interest.
